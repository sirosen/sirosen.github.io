<h1><a name="SALVE" class="anchor" href="#SALVE"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SALVE</h1>

<p><a href="http://sirosen.github.io/SALVE/">SALVE</a>
is a language designed for configuration deployment from a git repository.
Originally inspired by
<a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/radmind/">University of Michigan's Radmind</a>,
it originated as an answer to the common practice of keeping dotfiles and other personal configuration on github.
Although many of these repositories contain the components for a complex and highly personalized setup, the only way to automate deployment onto a new machine or virtual machine is through manual scripting.
Scripts are inherently dangerous and error-prone, containing numerous assumptions about permissions, directory structure, and so forth.
SALVE is intended to insulate the owners of such repos from concerns about correctness, safety, and idempotence.</p>

<h1><a name="hydra" class="anchor" href="#hydra"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hydra</h1>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sirosen/Hydra/">Hydra</a>
was an toy project I worked on with
<a href="http://github.com/courageousillumination">Tristan Rasmussen</a> while we both worked at the
<a href="http://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/">CSIL</a>.
We experimented on making a forkbomb as nefarious as we could.
Hydra renames its children, bounces back signals it receives (other than SIGKILL, of course), and begins mucking with shells and ttys it can get its hands on.
Running Hydra is dangerous to a system's health, but not to the state of the filesystem.</p>

<h1><a name="inv-parser" class="anchor" href="#inv-parser"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OSX inv_parser</h1>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sirosen/inv_parser/">inv_parser</a>
is an early verrsion of a package I wrote for the
<a href="http://csil.cs.uchicago.edu/">CSIL</a>
to parse the output of OSX's System Profiler.
The code kept in the GitHub repository is not actively maintained, but was an early iteration of the project.</p>

<p>Our experience across multiple versions of OSX was that the non-full textual output of System Profiler was a lot more stable than its plist output.
Although this may have improved in the recent past, the textual solution works across a wider range of versions.
In order simplify parsing, we convert the text to xml, and then run xpath expressions on the xml.
For this to be possible, I used several rewrites of special characters, and some other nonstandard practices.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/sirosen/inv_parser/">inv_parser</a>
is far from exemplary code, but it now has years of successful usage in a production context.
In spite of its quirks, it has continued to work well over this period.</p>

<h1><a name="dotpimizer" class="anchor" href="#dotpimizer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dotpimizer</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/courageousillumination/dotpimizer/">Dotpimizer</a>
was another small project on which I collaborated with
<a href="http://github.com/courageousillumination">Tristan Rasmussen</a>.
It was a small Hackathon project that we did to draw regexes as NFAs, but is not very well documented.
Dotpimizer has the nice feature of producing dot files for all stages of its NFA transformations, so that you can inspect and "watch" the NFA simplify.
The ultimate goal of the project was to optimize the regex and display the NFA transformations, but this was never fully achieved.</p>
