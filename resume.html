<h1><a name="code" class="anchor" href="#code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code</h1>

<p>This resume is scrapped from GitHub, and displayed in the form of a png.
The png is rendered with ImageMagick from a pdf as part of my compilation
process, but the real magic is behind the png.</p>

<p>The resume source is a JSON document -- it's exact schema is ill-defined,
since I'm the only one using it and it changes to suit my needs.
That JSON is rendered to LaTeX source file via ruby ERB templating (load from
JSON, scrub to texify things like ampersands and underscores, and run ERB), and
then handed off to <code>pdflatex</code> to do its wizardry.
There is a Makefile which exists to pass arguments to the ruby script, but does
little else.</p>

<p>Please feel free to use
<a href="https://github.com/sirosen/OpenResume">the source</a>
either as a jumping-off point for your own resume templating needs, or use the
generated LaTeX source as a template for your own Resume or CV.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of these templating shenanighans is to produce HTML output
which could be embedded and styled on this page.
I will begin work on this feature at a later date.</p>
