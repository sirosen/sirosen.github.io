A PyCon experiential review
====

In 2025, I attended PyCon US for the first time.
I cannot overstate how good of an experience it was.

I participated in and listened to some extremely difficult technical and
non-technical discussions.

All the while, I took text notes in an unstructured text doc on my phone.

I primarily appended new notes, and rarely edited prior ones.

These notes may not be usable for anyone else. They probably are not.

They are included here, only minimally edited, as an experiential review of
what PyCon was like.

When doing self invoking script, set and then *unset* env var at top of script
Actually tried this and it works in r53-tool

Use LLMs to get implementation plans / project overviews
Try using hugging face

Inviting designers and other non code contributions with docs

Retro: maybe don't, not particularly well qualified and may actually be harmful
Instead, write about active remembering and  Holocaust remembrance, where I have
more right to a public voice (aside: who has the right to speak on any topic?
All that is required is to be informed?)

Hack the LLM itself to make it do what you want
Treat the system adversarially, extract useful information from it
