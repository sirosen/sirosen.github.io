By Popular Request: How to Brew Turkish Coffee
=====

Recently, I started using my ibrik, often called a "Turkish coffee pot", to
brew coffee.
When I first did, I tweeted that this is some of the best coffee, maybe even
the best, that I've had, and several family members and friends asked how they
could make it.

I used several sources as guides, and therefore find it easiest to write this
down afresh.


An Appeasement to Purists
---

Anyone who takes turkish coffee seriously will scoff at the idea of adding
cream.
Although it violates the tradition of preparation and service of this drink,
the coffee it produces tastes *very* good.

Ultimately, this post is not about the traditions of brewing coffee, but about
producing a tasty drink.
Turkish coffee is very strong, similar to straight espresso, and will likely
taste harsh if you are used to drinking drip coffee or preparations of espresso
with milk.
To produce a more mild drink, I will happily encourage others to do as I do and
add a touch of cream to soften the taste.

Readying Your Kitchen
===

Ingredients
---

You will need the following to make a single serving:

 - 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp cold water, preferably filtered
 - 3 tbsp coffee beans OR 1.5 tbsp coffee beans very finely ground
 - (optional) 1/2 tbsp sugar
 - (optional) 1 whole cardamom pod
 - (optional) 1 tbsp cream

If you intend to make more than one serving, the amount of coffee you use
should increase slightly faster than the amount of water.
A good rule is hard to come by, but for two servings add 1 tbsp of coffee and
1/3 cup of water.

You will also need:

 - 1 ibrik
 - 1 trivet
 - 1 metal spoon
 - 1 stove
 - hands

The Grind
---

If you are using whole coffee beans, you should grind them very, very finely.
A traditional turkish hand grinder is ideal, but if, like me, you only have an
electric grinder, getting a sufficiently fine grind is difficult.

You want to reduce the beans to a powder finer than sand, which depending on
your grinder's make and model may require you to pass the grinds through
several phases.
With some grinders this is not possible, but for those which double as spice
grinders the main requirement is that you shake the grinder periodically and
take a long time.

Preparing to Prepare
---

Set out your trivet ahead of time, near your stove.
You will need to move the pot on and off of the heat several times as you
prepare the coffee.

Ensure that you have at least 15 minutes of time to stand by the stove at the
ready.
Brewing this coffee requires long waits punctuated by intense activity and
quick reactions.

Procedure
===

Let's get started.

First Steps
---

If you are including the sugar, and I strongly recommend doing so, mix it with
the cold water.
It doesn't need to be stirred and completely dissolved, as it will integrate
during the cooking process.

Pour the water into your ibrik, and spoon the ground coffee over the top.
*Do not mix or stir the coffee in.*
We want it to float on top of the water, and it will be integrated as we cook.

First Heating Cycle
---

Set your stove for low heat, just a little above a simmer.
Our goal is not to boil the water, but to induce a foaming effect.

Place the pot on the stove, and check on it at least once a minute.

![Coffee Before Foaming](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/first_heat.png)

It should take 5-10 minutes to begin foaming.
When it starts foaming, you will only have a few seconds to get it off of the
heat.

This is what the foam should look like as it starts, only a bubble or two:
![Foaming Just Starting](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/foaming_begins.png)

after 5 seconds or so, the bubbles will grow to an intermediate stage at which
it is first recognizably something you could call a foam.

However, this heralds a more violent and rapid rise in the bubbles.
![Foam Still Loading](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/foaming_before_violence.png)

I couldn't get a photo after this phase, as you want to get the foam to begin
rising rapidly before removing the pot from the heat.

Place the pot onto your trivet, but leave the heat on, your pot will return
there shortly.
If you have a gas stove like me, you can turn the heat off and back on, but
leaving it on for under 30 seconds is more foolproof.

Stir Down
---

Using the handle of a metal spoon, gently stir down the foam until it consists
only of a few bubbles on the surface of the proto-coffee.

Set the spoon aside, you'll need it more later.
I like to put it in my coffee cup to keep my counters clean:

Second Heat
---

Return the pot to the heat, and be ready for violent foaming.
This time, the foam will rise rapidly after only 30 seconds or so of heat.

![Wow Such Foam](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/second_foam2.png)

Save your stove and return the pot to the trivet.
Leave the heat on (if you live dangerously) as we'll be heating the pot a third
time.

Stir Down Again
---

Stir the coffee down a second time, again just trying to settle the bubbles.

Third Heat
---

Be ready this time -- on the third heating, the foam will rise vigorously only
moments after the pot touches the heat.

It was too fast for me to snap a good photo, but make sure to remove the coffee
before it boils.

Let It Stand
---

After the third heating, do not stir down.
The foam is part of the drink in its final form, and should be preserved.

Let the coffee stand for at least 30 seconds before serving.

If you are going to opt for cream, now would be a good time to add it to the
bottom of your cup.

As a more traditional alternative to the cream, you can place a single whole
cardamom pod in the bottom of the cup.
This will give you a very strong flavor of cardamom, which balances the bitter
and acidic tones of the coffee.

Pour Carefully
---

You want to pour the coffee very slowly.
This will take advantage of the ibrik's shape to keep most of the grounds in
the pot.
Note the thinness of the stream shown below.

![Very Pour, Wow](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/slow_pour.png)

Do not pour out all of the liquid -- when you see many grounds coming along for
the ride, slow your pour even more if you can, and eventually stop.
You won't be able to keep all of the grounds out, but you should be left with a
thick sludge in your pot:

![Much Sludge](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/pot_sludge.png)

There's no good use for this I know of, although I want to try using it for a
coffee milkshake.
Until we learn otherwise, just wash out the pot with hot water and gentle
application of a sponge or cleaning rag by the lip.
The slude should leave it gracefully.

Drink Carefully Too
---

Because some coffee grounds enter the cup inevitably during the pour, be sure
to only drink until you encounter the first few grounds.
The last dregs of your cup are not good eating.

![Such Empty](/assets/blog_content/turkish_coffee/empty_cup.png)

This cup qualifies as "empty" for me.
